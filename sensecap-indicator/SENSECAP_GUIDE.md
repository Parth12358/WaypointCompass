- **Rugged enclosure**: Designed for harsh environments

### 📡 **Enhanced Connectivity**
- **WiFi + BLE**: Same as generic ESP32 but with better antennas
- **LoRa radio**: Long-range communication up to 10km
- **Grove connector**: Easy expansion with Seeed sensors

### 💻 **Professional Software**
- **LVGL framework**: Professional GUI library instead of TFT_eSPI
- **Better performance**: Dedicated display controller with DMA
- **Power management**: Optimized for battery operation

## Hardware Differences

| Feature | Generic ESP32 Build | SenseCAP Indicator |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Display** | SPI interface (ILI9341) | RGB parallel (ST7701S) |
| **Touch** | SPI resistive (XPT2046) | I2C capacitive (FT6336U) |
| **Resolution** | 480×320 | 480×480 |
| **UI Framework** | TFT_eSPI | LVGL |
| **Enclosure** | DIY required | IP54 professional |
| **Power** | External required | Built-in battery |
| **Extra Features** | None | LoRa, Grove, charging |

## Build Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install ESP-IDF v5.0+
# Set up ESP-IDF environment variables
# Connect SenseCAP Indicator via USB-C
```

### 2. Build Process
```bash
# Navigate to SenseCAP project
cd sensecap-indicator

# Build for SenseCAP Indicator
build.bat
# or manual commands:
# idf.py set-target esp32s3
# copy sdkconfig.sensecap sdkconfig  
# idf.py build
```

### 3. Flash to Device
```bash
# Flash to SenseCAP Indicator
idf.py -p COMx flash monitor

# Replace COMx with your device's COM port
# Usually COM3, COM4, etc. on Windows
```

```

## Key Adaptations Made

### 1. Display System
**Changed from**: TFT_eSPI library with SPI interface
**Changed to**: LVGL with RGB parallel interface

```c
// Old TFT_eSPI approach:
tft.fillScreen(TFT_BLACK);
tft.drawString("Hello", 100, 50);

// New LVGL approach:
lv_obj_set_style_bg_color(screen, lv_color_black(), 0);
lv_obj_t *label = lv_label_create(screen);
lv_label_set_text(label, "Hello");
```

### 2. Touch Interface
**Changed from**: SPI resistive touch with coordinate mapping
**Changed to**: I2C capacitive touch with LVGL integration

```c
// Old resistive touch:
if (tft.getTouch(&x, &y)) {
    handleTouch(x, y);
}

// New capacitive touch:
// Automatically handled by LVGL input device
// Touch events delivered via LVGL callbacks
```

### 3. Professional UI Framework
**LVGL Benefits**:
- Object-oriented UI components
- Automatic layout management
- Professional animations and transitions
- Better memory management
- Touch gesture support

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **Completed Components**
- **Display driver**: RGB parallel interface with LVGL
- **Touch controller**: I2C capacitive touch with FT6336U
- **Main application**: LVGL-based UI with menu system
- **GPS handler**: BLE communication (same as ESP-IDF)
- **Network manager**: HTTP client for backend APIs
- **Navigation calculations**: Haversine math functions

### 🔨 **Ready for Enhancement**
