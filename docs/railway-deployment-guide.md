# Railway Deployment Guide for WaypointCompass

## Quick Railway Setup (5 minutes!)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project
Your project is already ready! The TTS system we just built will work perfectly on Railway.

### Step 2: Sign Up for Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Authorize Railway to access your repositories

### Step 3: Deploy Your Project
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose `Parth12358/WaypointCompass`
4. Railway automatically detects Node.js and starts building

### Step 4: Add MongoDB Database
1. In your project dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "Add MongoDB"
3. Railway creates a MongoDB instance and provides connection string
4. The `MONGODB_URL` environment variable is automatically set

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab, add:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=${MONGODB_URL}
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

### Step 6: Get Your API URL
After deployment, Railway provides your API URL like:
```
https://waypointcompass-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

### Step 7: Update ESP32 Code
Replace your backend URL in ESP32:
```cpp
const char* BACKEND_URL = "https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app";
```
